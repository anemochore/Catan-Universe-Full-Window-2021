# Catan-Universe-Full-Window-2021

## Description
Makes Catan Universe full window, working as of 2021.

## Notes
I have found [the other userscript](https://userstyles.org/styles/157378/catan-universe-full-window) which does not work perfectly anymore, so decided to upload mine.

## Usage
Use with [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or similar extensions. The same CSS code is also published on https://userstyles.org/styles/210126/catan-universe-full-window-2021. If you really don't want to use Stylus, etc. and have [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed, you can use `inject_css.js` instead.
